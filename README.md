# InfraredController-Servo

 !!!!! PLEASE REMEMBER ATTRIBUTION!!!!!

This is an Infrared controller that controls servo motors by reading the values from 2 infrared sensors (one for each motor).
 
 
 One can use this in a variety of ways, including:
 
-> Turning sensors upside-down and controlling servos with your fist on a table
 
-> Performing 'magic' by controlling servos with the tips of your fingers
  
-> ... or just showing off to friends and family!
 

Components List:

-> 2 Servo Motors

-> Arduino Uno / Nano
 
-> 2 Infrared Sensors
 

Software requirements:
 
-> Arduino IDE
  
-> Servo motors library
